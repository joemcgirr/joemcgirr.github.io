Iâ€™m a bioinformatics scientist specializing in evolution and population biology. I have a Ph.D. in biology from the University of North Carolina and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Whitehead lab](https://whiteheadresearch.wordpress.com/) at UC Davis. My projects combine evolutionary theory with next generation sequencing data to answer questions at the intersection of basic and applied research. For more about my interests, check out [Research](https://joemcgirr.github.io/research/) and [Publications](https://joemcgirr.github.io/publications/)
