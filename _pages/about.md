I’m a bioinformatics scientist working in research and development at Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Our team improves existing microarray technology and develops new genotyping products. 

In my current role, I specialize in:

 -	Data Analysis and Interpretation: Processing large biological datasets on high-performance clusters. Conducting analyses with modern data science tools and statistical methods. Communicating interpretations that guide product development decisions.
 -	Pipeline and Algorithm Development: Building workflows that automate complex processes. Creating applications and reports with interactive visualizations that enable scientists to explore their results. Working with software developers to implement my tools in user-facing programs.
 -	Cross-Functional Collaboration: Representing bioinformatics on teams directing new product introductions and incubation projects. Presenting at scientific conferences and departmental seminars. Collaborating with scientists internally to design experiments. Collaborating with external scientists to design products specific to their research applications. 

   

Before joining industry, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Whitehead Lab](https://whiteheadresearch.wordpress.com/) 
at the University of California Davis affiliated with the Center for Population Biology. 
I received my PhD in biology from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill 
as a member of the [Martin Lab](http://ib.berkeley.edu/labs/martin/).
