Iâ€™m a bioinformatics scientist specializing in evolutionary genetics and population biology. I have a Ph.D. in biology from the University of North Carolina and have published research in genomics and transcriptomics in prominent journals including Molecular Biology and Evolution, Evolution Letters, and Molecular Ecology. My projects combine evolutionary theory with next generation sequencing data to answer questions at the intersection of basic and applied research.
