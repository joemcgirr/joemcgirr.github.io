Iâ€™m a bioinformatics scientist specializing in evolutionary genetics and population biology. I have a Ph.D. in biology from the University of North Carolina and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Whitehead lab at UC Davis. My projects combine evolutionary theory with next generation sequencing data to answer questions at the intersection of basic and applied research. For more about my interests, check out [Research](https://joemcgirr.github.io/research/) and [Publications](https://joemcgirr.github.io/publications/)
