```{r setup, include=FALSE}

Iâ€™m a bioinformatics scientist working in research and development at Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Our team improves existing microarray technology and develops new genotyping products. 

In my current role, I specialize in:

  - Experimental Design -- I work closely with molecular biologists to design efficient experiments.
  - Data Analysis -- I process large biological data sets on high performance computing clusters,
  perform analyses using modern data science tools, and communicate interpretations that drive product development decisions.
  - Pipeline Development -- I build workflows that automate repetitive processes and create apps with interactive visualizations, 
  enabling molecular biologists to quickly explore their results.
  - Algorithm Development -- I write tools to perform a variety of analyses and work closely with software developers to implement 
  them into production level code.
   

Before joining industry, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Whitehead Lab](https://whiteheadresearch.wordpress.com/) 
at the University of California Davis affiliated with the Center for Population Biology. 
I received my PhD in biology from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill 
as a member of the [Martin Lab](http://ib.berkeley.edu/labs/martin/).
