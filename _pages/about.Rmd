```{r setup, include=FALSE}

Iâ€™m a bioinformatics scientist specializing in genetics and population biology. I research copy number variation in the human genome and develop genotyping products at Thermo Fisher Scientific. Before joining industry, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Whitehead Lab](https://whiteheadresearch.wordpress.com/) at the University of California Davis affiliated with the Center for Population Biology. I received my PhD in biology from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill as a member of the [Martin Lab](http://ib.berkeley.edu/labs/martin/).  For more about my interests, check out [Publications](https://joemcgirr.github.io/publications/)





```{r, echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
library(knitr)

  opts_knit$set(base.url = base.url)
  fig.path <- paste0("images/", sub(".Rmd$", "", basename(input)), "/")
  opts_chunk$set(fig.path = fig.path)
  opts_chunk$set(fig.cap = "center")
  render_jekyll()
  knit(input, envir = parent.frame())
